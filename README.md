# Teaching

Wait, why is this a GitHub page? It is a GitHub page because my teaching combines theory and practice. In the case of media studies, the history and philosophy of technology, the digital humanities, and other disciplines related to my research this means close reading and writing code as much as close reading and writing critical prose.

## Classes

I am offering two classes at the University of California, Santa Barbara: a graduate seminar on the aesthetics and politics of artificial intelligence, and an upper division class on machine learning and the arts. In addition, I am currently preparing a graduate seminar on computability. The links below lead to the respective syllabi, course descriptions, and code repositories.
